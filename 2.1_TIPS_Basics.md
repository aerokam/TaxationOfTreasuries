## TIPS-Specific Terms

**TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities):** Marketable Treasury securities whose principal is adjusted by changes in the Consumer Price Index

**CPI-U (NSA):** Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Non-Seasonally Adjusted
- Published monthly by Bureau of Labor Statistics
- Released mid-month for prior month data

**Reference CPI:** Daily interpolated value used for TIPS calculations
```
For 1st of month:
  refCPI(month, 1) = CPI-U(month - 3)

For days 2-31:
  refCPI(month, day) = refCPI(month, 1) + 
                       (refCPI(month+1, 1) - refCPI(month, 1)) * 
                       (day - 1) / daysInMonth
```

**Dated Date:** 15th of the month in which TIPS was issued

**Ref CPI on Dated Date:** Reference CPI on the dated date (constant for bond lifetime)

**Index Ratio:**
```
indexRatio(date) = refCPI(date) / refCPI(datedDate)
```

## Inflation-Adjusted Calculations

**Inflation-Adjusted Principal:**
```
adjustedPrincipal = faceValue * indexRatio
```

**Inflation-Adjusted Annual Interest:**
```
adjustedAnnualInterest = adjustedPrincipal * couponRate
```

**Inflation-Adjusted Semi-Annual Interest:**
```
adjustedSemiAnnualInterest = adjustedAnnualInterest / 2
```

## TIPS-Specific Rules

**TIPS Maturity Dates:** Always 15th of month (Jan, Feb, Apr, Jul, Oct)

**Last-Year Interest (TIPS):**
- Jan-Jun maturity: 1 payment in final year
- Jul-Dec maturity: 2 payments in final year
```
For Jan maturity (month 1 < 7):
  lastYearInterest = adjustedAnnualInterest * 0.5

For Jul maturity (month 7 ≥ 7):
  lastYearInterest = adjustedAnnualInterest * 1.0
```

**P+I per Bond (TIPS):**
```
piPerBond = adjustedPrincipal + lastYearInterest
```
